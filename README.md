# HerdUp Mobile App

This was a mobile app I helped develop in the Spring 2025 with Texas Convergent. We primarily aimed at expanding HornsLink, an online student organization finder for UT Austin, to a mobile app with extra features that could be personable for students and organizations alike- sort of like a "mini Linkedin" for UT Austin.

I developed the sign-in/sign-up implementation along with the database setup, and the calendar/events/RSVP pages. 

This project was manned by around 15-20 people, based in product, design, and tech teams.
